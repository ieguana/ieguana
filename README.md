## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ“– Minecraft mod translator
  - **Mods I translated for:**  
    - [Biomes O' Plenty (BOP)](https://github.com/Glitchfiend/BiomesOPlenty)  
    - [Biomes We've Gone (BWG)](https://github.com/Potion-Studios/Oh-The-Biomes-Weve-Gone) + [All The Wood We've Got (WWG)](https://github.com/Potion-Studios/All-The-Wood-Weve-Got)
    - [Split Self](https://github.com/Pryzmm/Split-Self)
    - [Wayfinder](https://github.com/Potion-Studios/Wayfinder)
- </> I have *some* bit of Java knowledge, also some CSS and HTML knowledge, and a few bits of C# knowledge too
  - Keep in mind that since I prefer (Neo)Forge, I have more modding knowledge in (Neo)Forge than in Fabric or one of the other dozens of modloaders that exist
- ðŸ›  Coding tools I use: IntelliJ IDEA, VS2019, Forge / NeoForge modding toolkit
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about everything on the [issues tab](https://github.com/ieguana/ieguana/issues)!
